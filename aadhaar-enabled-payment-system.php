						<p>Remember, at the time of Aadhaar enrolment, your fingerprints and iris image were taken. These biometric data gets linked to the given Aadhaar number. These biometric data is unique to a person. No two person have the same iris image or fingerprints.  Thus, your Aadhaar number can be verified by your finger prints.

						<p>AEPS gives a lot of convenience to the rural people. It brings the bank to their doorstep and saves much time and transport expense. It would be just like a visit of the ATM at every doorstep. That is why government calls the POS as micro ATM. Using this platform, one can pay to the merchant without the card or mobile. The thumb impression is used for authentication.</p>
