                        <p>It was few years back when Indian homes had a limited set of phones. It was a revolution when in July 1995 the first Mobile telephonic conversation happened between West Bengal's the then Chief Minister Shri Jyoti Basu and the then Union Telecom Minister Shri Sukh Ram. This was a revolution in India and today each household with a family member of 4 has minimum 3 handsets. The handsets are either low end to high end smart phones like iPhone or Android OS. Roughly a mobile phone is being sold every second. Such an explosion in the number of users has been fuelled by a factor of PPT: price, policy and technology.
